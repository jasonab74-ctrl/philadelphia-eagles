But through multiple moves and college, swoop is nowhere to be found.</p> <p>Anyways, I'm looking to find a replacement swoop. Ive drawn a picture of what he looked like. He had long arms that almost reached his feet, and i want to say he was around maybe a foot and a half long. I got him some time between 2007-2012.</p> <p>I know this is a long shot, but if anybody has a picture of this specific doll or knows when it was produced that would be a great help in finding my long lost friend.</p> <p>Thank you for reading!

I’ve been looking to add one to the collection to wear to games during winter this upcoming season. The market is flooded with Vintage starter jackets. They bring back great memories and look good. But I simply don’t think I’ve seen a better looking jacket than this one from Pro Player in 1994. </p> <p>What do you guys think ? Do you guys still think Starter &gt; all others when it comes to vintage Eagles Jackets?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aussie_Spur\"> /u/Aussie_Spur </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nb6ax6\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/eagles/comments/1nb6ax6/starter_jackets_vs_pro_player/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"
